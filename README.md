# cpp00
Introduction to C++ and OOP.
- **ex00**: Work with `iostream` and `strig` classes to output arguments passed to a program in uppercase format.
- **ex01**: Create a PhoneBook that can store 8 contacts. If a user what to add more contacts older stored contact will be replaced with the new one. Phonebook available commands are `ADD`, `SEARCH` and `EXIT`. `ADD` ask the user to input contact details, `SEARCH` display a table of contacts and request the user to specify a contact to return the details of that contact and `EXIT` close the PhoneBook removing stored contacts. In this exercise I practice how to **create a class with private and public attributes and functions, manage input, formated output and catch exceptions**.
- **ex02**: Given an output file, main and `.hpp` file I have to implement the `.cpp` file of a class to obtain the given output file. In this exercise I learn about **non member attributes and functions**.
